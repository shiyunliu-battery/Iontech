### 2. Lithium-Ion Battery Field Data: 28 LFP battery systems with 8 cells in series, up to 5 years of operation
This data set contains data from 28 portable 24V lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery systems with approximately 160Ah nominal capacity. Each system's specific use case is unknown, but battery systems of this size are typically used as power sources for recreational vehicles, solar energy storage, and more.

All battery systems in this data set showed some form of unsatisfactory behavior and were returned to the manufacturer. Many reasons can cause a consumer to return a battery to the manufacturer for maintenance. The user's individual decisions may be motivated by personal judgment, BMS warnings, or customer support advice. This data set comprises a very small fraction of batteries sold of this version. Therefore, this data set is biased and not representative of the operational data of the entire population of this system version. An improved version replaced this battery system type. The battery system manufacturer provided the data set for this study and allowed its open-source release under the condition of anonymity.

Each battery system consists of 8 prismatic cells in series. Each system has one load current sensor, and each cell has one voltage sensor. The four temperature sensors are placed between adjacent cells, i.e., each temperature sensor is shared by two cells. Furthermore, the battery systems have active cell balancing. The available measurements vary from a single month to five years. Consequently, the number of data rows per system varies from several thousand to millions, depending on the duration of battery operation. The data set contains a total of 133 million rows of measurements.

### 3. Battery Failure Databank
The Battery Failure Databank features data collected from hundreds of abuse tests conducted on commercial lithium-ion batteries. Methods of abuse include nail penetration, thermal abuse, and internal short-circuiting.

This databank provides the heat output from cells undergoing thermal runaway, the breakdown of heat from the cell casing and its ejected contents, as well as the mass of the cells before and after thermal runaway and the quantity of mass ejected from the cell. The databank also organizes the stored data for understanding test-to-test variability for each cell type and trigger mechanism combination.

Additionally, most tests feature associated high-speed X-ray radiography videos for review alongside the data.

### 38. Dataset - Dynamic cycling enhances battery lifetime
The study presents a systematic comparison of dynamic discharge profiles, representative of electric vehicle driving, with constant-current discharge profiles, commonly used in laboratory testing. The results indicate that dynamic discharge profiles can extend the lifetime of lithium-ion batteries significantly. Specifically, under identical average current and voltage conditions, dynamic profiles result in up to a 38% increase in equivalent full cycles at the battery's end-of-life. This enhancement is attributed to the influence of low-frequency current pulses and time-induced aging, as revealed through explainable machine learning. These findings emphasize the necessity of incorporating realistic load profiles in the evaluation of new battery chemistries and designs to better understand aging mechanisms and improve battery performance.

### 46. Model-Constrained Deep Learning for Online Fault Diagnosis in Li-ion Batteries over Stochastic Conditions
The authors utilize data uploaded from vehicle onboard Battery Management Systems (BMS) for network design. They have released a real-world vehicle dataset containing 18.2 million valid entries collected from 515 vehicles, which was gathered by the BMS data center on the cloud.
The dataset primarily consists of data from three battery manufacturers, which, due to confidentiality restrictions, are referred to as DTI, QAS, and GIS in the paper. In addition to normal operating data, the dataset also includes four types of rare and critical safety failure samples: Thermal runaway, Electrolyte leakage, Internal short circuit, Excessive ageing.

### 47. Data from: "Lithium-ion battery degradation: comprehensive cycle ageing data and analysis for commercial 21700 cells"
These data were generated from battery cell ageing experiments that included break-in cycles and Reference Performance Tests (RPTs), alternating with performance checks and ageing cycles. Each cell was base-cooled at set temperatures using bespoke rigs, with full experimental details available in linked publications. The repository is structured according to each “Experiment,” containing folders for “Summary Data,” “Processed Timeseries Data,” and “Raw Data.” The “Summary Data” folder holds metrics such as capacity, resistance, degradation mode analysis, and ageing statistics. “Processed Timeseries Data” includes subtest-specific voltage, current, and temperature in .csv files, while “Raw Data” comprises proprietary .mpr and .mpt files. An “experimental_metadata” .xlsx and a Jupyter notebook are provided for straightforward data parsing, analysis, and visualization.
